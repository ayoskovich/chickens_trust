# ## Data sources
# 
# In order to validate the claims from [this](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-11/why-chicken-is-plentiful-during-the-pandemic-and-beef-is-not?srnd=premium&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_content=markets&cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-markets&sref=XQtHDW1P) article, I pulled price data from FRED (which sources data from the BLS) and adjusted it using the CPI. Data sources are here:
# 
# - [CPI (for inflation)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL)
# - [Poultry](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/APU0000706111)
# - [Pork](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/APU0000FD3101)
# - [Beef](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/APU0000703112)
# 
# **A note here**: I couldn't for the life of me, find any data that goes back to 1935, like Fox cites in the article. The earliest history I could find from FRED or the BLS only goes back to the 80s, so I must be missing something!
# 
# The following graphic shows to historic prices (adjusted for inflation) of the 3 types of meats described.

# In order to summarize the price change since the historic price, I'll simply take the percentage difference between the oldest and most recent price.

# ## Claims
# 
# > "poultry costs U.S. consumers 62% less in inflation-adjusted terms than it did in 1935"
# 
# > "Pork, now also raised mostly at factory scale indoors, is 12% cheaper"
# 
# > "Beef, which isnâ€™t, costs 63% more."
# 
# Here's what I found:
# 
# - From 1980 - 2020, chicken prices have declined 31.5%.
# - From 1998 - 2020, the price of pork has declined 26%.
# - From 1984 - 2020, the price of beef has increased 25.3%.

# Comparing claims
TYPES = ['chicken', 'pork', 'beef']

diff = pd.DataFrame({
    'type':TYPES,
    'mine':[get_diff(df, x, True) for x in TYPES],
    'his' :[-.62, -.12, .63]
})
diff['diff'] = diff['mine'] - diff['his']
# print(diff.to_markdown())

# |    | type    |      mine |   his |      diff |
# |---:|:--------|----------:|------:|----------:|
# |  0 | chicken | -0.314954 | -0.62 |  0.305046 |
# |  1 | pork    | -0.266726 | -0.12 | -0.146726 |
# |  2 | beef    |  0.253233 |  0.63 | -0.376767 |

# ## Market Reactions
# 
# - Where do we define "coronavirus is here"
# - Look at pct change in price for all 3 items

# ## Final Notes
# 
# - Maybe I deflated prices using a different CPI than the author
# - My numbers certainly aren't in the same date range?
