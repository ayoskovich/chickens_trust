### Data sources

In order to validate the claims from [this](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-11/why-chicken-is-plentiful-during-the-pandemic-and-beef-is-not?srnd=premium&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_content=markets&cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-markets&sref=XQtHDW1P) article, I pulled data from the FRED database, which pulls from the BLS. Each link will take you to the exact series that I downloaded here.

- [CPI (for inflation)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL)
- [Poultry](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/APU0000706111)
- [Pork](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/APU0000FD3101)
- [Beef](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/APU0000703112)

The data from the fred does NOT go back to 1935, I'm not 100% sure where that historic data is coming from...
