## Data sources

In order to validate the claims from [this](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-11/why-chicken-is-plentiful-during-the-pandemic-and-beef-is-not?srnd=premium&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_content=markets&cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-markets&sref=XQtHDW1P) article, I pulled price data from FRED (which sources data from the BLS) and adjusted it using the CPI. Data sources are here:

- [CPI (for inflation)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL)
- [Poultry](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/APU0000706111)
- [Pork](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/APU0000FD3101)
- [Beef](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/APU0000703112)

**A note here**: I couldn't for the life of me, find any data that goes back to 1935, like Fox cites in the article. The earliest history I could find from FRED or the BLS only goes back to the 80s, so I must be missing something!

The following graphic shows to historic prices (adjusted for inflation) of the 3 types of meats described.

In order to summarize the price change since the historic price, I'll simply take the percentage difference between the oldest and most recent price.

## Claims

> "poultry costs U.S. consumers 62% less in inflation-adjusted terms than it did in 1935"

> "Pork, now also raised mostly at factory scale indoors, is 12% cheaper"

> "Beef, which isnâ€™t, costs 63% more."

Here's what I found:

- From 1980 - 2020, chicken prices have declined 31.5%.
- From 1998 - 2020, the price of pork has declined 26%.
- From 1984 - 2020, the price of beef has increased 25.3%.

|    | type    |      mine |   his |      diff |
|---:|:--------|----------:|------:|----------:|
|  0 | chicken | -0.314954 | -0.62 |  0.305046 |
|  1 | pork    | -0.266726 | -0.12 | -0.146726 |
|  2 | beef    |  0.253233 |  0.63 | -0.376767 |

But let's take a break really quick here, because there is a glaring problem. The date ranges of the data I used are different than the date ranges that he used, because his data goes back to 1935. Let's add to our table the number of years that the change occurred over.

|    | type    |   my num |   his num |   diff |
|---:|:--------|---------:|----------:|-------:|
|  0 | chicken |       40 |        85 |    -45 |
|  1 | pork    |       22 |        85 |    -63 |
|  2 | beef    |       36 |        85 |    -49 |

## Market Reactions

- Where do we define "coronavirus is here"
- Look at pct change in price for all 3 items

## Final Notes

- Maybe I deflated prices using a different CPI than the author
- My numbers certainly aren't in the same date range?
